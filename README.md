Project Overview:- 

Predictive Modeling for Market Change and Time to Reach:-
This project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately predict two outcomes: the numerical change in the market over a specific time frame and the time it will take to reach that change. The goal is to maximize the company's overall gain based on a profit and loss structure. The project uses a hybrid approach combining machine learning and deep learning techniques and is implemented using Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and Prophet.
